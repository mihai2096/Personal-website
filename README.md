# Towing site

## Description

   This website has been done for a local towing company in Focsani, Romania. The website is still live on the web but I do not own the domain anymore and needs fixes for responsiveness and to be added a gallery page. I've learned about frontend and web development with the help of this project. The project was not continued due to disagreements with the client.

## Technologies used

In order to code this website I've used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
